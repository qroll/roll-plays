this project was created as an exercise in dockerizing and hosting an application, and also to try out rich text editing with draftjs and markdown

... hah

this is really just an excuse to play more video games

see me at http://rollplays.me!

yes, i'm aware that all the secret keys and logins are visible, but it's not like you can do anything with them, except add amazing games like Mirror's Edge and Dishonored to my list ðŸ‘Œ

### todo list
- [ ] enable HTTPS
- [ ] figure out how to set up a subdomain like api.rollplays.me
- [ ] fancy blur filter
- [ ] animations are always good, right?
- [ ] maybe actually play some video games, because that backlog is not going away on its own
